### TasksApp

Simple way to manage your tasks within different projects.
TasksApp solution focuses on delivering front-end solution but includes mocked api as back-end service using json-server

### Reasoning behind our technical choices, including architectural

Solution built using several libraries i.e ReactJS, redux, redux-sagas and immrjs.
